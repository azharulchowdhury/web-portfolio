            <h3>Maintenance Engineer</h3>
            <p>I am very qualified to modify the existing mechanical system to ensure better reliability as well as cost effective. I am very concern for energy saving and capital cost management. I have worked in a FDA approved facility and reduce the annual downtime about 3%. Now I start learning web developing. If I can be skilled then it will help me to work from home.  </p>
